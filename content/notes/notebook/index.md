One day, I wanted to make a notebook. I liked it, so I made more. Then I got tired of it and stopped. This is an archive of the material that I published about this.

This was originally the report of the first notebook build. Moved that to a sub-page, and turned this note into an archive page that gives an overview over my whole notebook-making adventure.

I started out with a single notebook. I published a <a href="/notes/notebook/original-build/">detailed report about this original build</a>. I made 6 notebooks overall, and created a page to present each one:

- <a href="/notes/notebook/1/">Notebook #1</a>
- <a href="/notes/notebook/2/">Notebook #2</a>
- <a href="/notes/notebook/3/">Notebook #3</a>
- <a href="/notes/notebook/4/">Notebook #4</a>
- <a href="/notes/notebook/5/">Notebook #5</a>
- <a href="/notes/notebook/6/">Notebook #6</a>

These notebooks were an open source hardware product (emphasis on *open source*, less so on the *hard* part). I collected all documentation on how to source materials and how to build them in a GitHub repository: {{ ext_link(text="https://github.com/hannobraun/notebooks", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/notebooks") }}

I eventually stopped making them. I didn't have the right tools, which made the process hard to control, tedious, and eventually frustrating. I didn't want to invest any more in tooling (either in the form of money or labor), so I decided to call it quits.

Overall, it was a fun experiment on how to manufacture a specific kind of product. I even sold a few, which was a nice feeling. I hope to eventually repeat that, but probably with something else.
