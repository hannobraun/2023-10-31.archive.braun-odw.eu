I have a notebook that I use almost daily. After watching a DiResta video or two about making notebooks, I was inspired to try my hand at creating one of my own. I had also wanted to try cork leather for a while, and this seemed like a great opportunity.

I'm currently using a Moleskine notebook (and have for years), with the following attributes:
- Pocket-sized, a bit smaller than {{ ext_link(text="A6", url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216") }}. That's large enough to be useful, and small enough to fit in my back pocket.
- Soft cover, as having a hard cover in my back pocket doesn't feel that great.
- Rounded corners, to further improve the back pocket feel.

That is what I wanted to replicate with my own build. Here's the result.

    )
}}

It's far from perfect, but I'm very happy with it. Especially for a first try.

        alt="An open notebook with blank pages. The sides of the paper are visibly rough."
    )
}}

I had planned this project for a while, but kept procrastinating. Beyond the attributes laid out above, there were still so many decisions to make and things to consider. I finally decided that enough was enough, and that I was going to just keep it simple for the first go:

- Just use printer paper. Probably not the best choice, but I already had it, and I figured it would do fine.
- Blank pages. This did simplify things, as I got to use printer paper and didn't have to care about perfect orientation of every page.
- No frills. My Moleskine notebooks have this flexible band, to keep the notebook closed, and a bookmark ribbon. Nice, but I can do without those.
- I decided to go for 192 pages, as that's the same number as my usual notebooks have. Seemed like a good number.

I would have preferred grid pattern paper, but figured I wouldn't be able to create something to replace my daily notebook anyway, on the first try. So I decided I would use the notebook mostly for sketches, for which the blank paper would work fine.

With those decisions made, I was finally ready to get started!


### Tools

There were a few tools I needed. The only substantial one, which I decided to build myself, was a book press.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/book-press.jpg",
        alt="A book press, built from two cutting boards and some bolts and wing nuts from the hardware store."
    )
}}

I adapted the concept from {{ ext_link(text="this video by Sea Lemon on YouTube", url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeg8MH0PtI") }}. It didn't come out great, but it was cheap, and easy to do. The only real problem is, it's too big. I built this not only with the notebook in mind, but also with the idea that I might want to bind some ebooks I like, that aren't available to buy in paper form.

Figuring that since I can print A4 paper at home, I was going to need an A4-sized book press. Forgetting, of course, that I need to fold the paper to bind it as a book. So an A5-sized press would have been more than enough. Oh well.

Other than the book press, I only needed some small stuff, all of which I already has or ordered from {{ ext_link(text="Modulor", url="https://www.modulor.de/en/") }}:

- A knife
- A ruler
- {{ ext_link(text="An awl", url="https://www.modulor.de/en/awl-l-125-mm-incl-point.html") }}
- {{ ext_link(text="Bookbinding needles", url="https://www.modulor.de/en/bookbinding-needle-l-62-mm-o-1-2-mm.html") }}
- Sandpaper
- {{ ext_link(text="A corner punch for rounded corners", url="https://www.modulor.de/en/corner-punch-for-roundeed-corners-radius-ca-10-mm.html") }}


### Materials

Like the tools, all of the materials required were pretty cheap and easily available:

- Paper: As explained above, I just decided to use printer paper.
- {{ ext_link(text="Binder's thread", url="https://www.modulor.de/en/linen-binder-s-thread-th-0-42mm-type-30-3-150m-black.html") }}
- PVA glue
- {{ ext_link(text="Cork leather", url="https://cork-shop.com/Korkleder-Korkstoff-vegan-Leder-naehen-basteln-kreativ-viele-Designs-und-Abmessungen-Acacia-35x25cm_1") }} for the cover


### The Build

The first step was to create a text block. I'd never done this before, so I just followed {{ ext_link(text="another video by Sea Lemon", url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGQ5P8QVHSg") }} on YouTube.

#### Preparing the paper

First problem: I have A4 paper, but need (roughly) A5-sized paper. Solution: Fold them, cut the folded end off.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/01-a4-folded.jpg",
        alt="A stack of folded A4 paper."
    )
}}

{{
    video(
        path="/notes/notebook/02-a4-cut.webm",
        text="Cutting the fold off of folded A4 paper to create A5-ish paper."
    )
}}

Repeating that a bunch of times gave me a nice stack of A5-ish paper.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/03-a5-stack.jpg",
        alt="A stack of A5-ish sized paper."
    )
}}

Next, I folded it and stacked it in groups of 4.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/04-a5-folded.jpg",
        alt="A stack of folded A5-ish sized paper, stacked in groups of 4."
    )
}}

#### Making and preparing the signatures

Now I needed to needed to make the signatures. A signature is a group of 4 folded papers, nested within one another.

{{
    video(
        path="/notes/notebook/05-signature-grouping.webm",
        text="Nesting the groups of papers into one another."
    )
}}

Yes, I work fast.

To create a text block, the signatures are sewn together. For that, I needed holes, so I marked the signatures where I wanted to make those.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/06-signatures-marked.jpg",
        alt="The stack of signatures, with markings to show where holes should be made."
    )
}}

Making the holes with the awl was straight-forward.

{{
    video(
        path="/notes/notebook/07-signatures-holes.webm",
        text="Nesting the groups of papers into one another."
    )
}}

At this point, I spotted this rare and wondrous sight: a wild shop dog.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/shop-dog.jpg",
        alt="A dog lying under the workshop table, between my feet."
    )
}}

#### Sewing and glueing the text block

Next, I sewed the signatures together to make the text block.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/08-text-block.jpg",
        alt="The signatures, sewn together into a text block."
    )
}}

Unfortunately I don't have any video from here on, but I did it exactly as shown in {{ ext_link(text="the video I followed", url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGQ5P8QVHSg") }}.

I glued the text block using two coats of PVA glue.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/09-text-block-glued.jpg",
        alt="The text block, pressed together in the book pressed, with PVA glue applied along its spine."
    )
}}

#### Cover and finishing

This is where I went a bit off the rails. The Sea Lemon video shows adding an end page to each side, and a piece of paper to the spine. At least the piece of paper on the spine would have been a good idea for me too, as the signatures ended up moving. But more on that below.

I just glued a piece of cork leather directly on the text block.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/10-cover-glue-up.jpg",
        alt="The text block, a piece of cork leather glued around it as the cover, in the book press."
    )
}}

The glue-up resulted in the signatures moving, and a large gap forming between the spine and the cover.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/11-notebook-spine-gap.jpg",
        alt="A close-up of the notebook, shown from the side. The signatures have moved relative to each other. The spine of the text block is no longer straight, an there's a large gap between the spine and the cover in that location."
    )
}}

This is the aspect of the build I'm least happy with. Next time, I'll definitely add a paper to stabilize the spine. Possibly, I'll also glue the cover in two stages, one side at a time. Having one half of the cover fixed might help with getting a tighter fit while positioning the other half.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/12-notebook-unfinished.jpg",
        alt="The notebook, glued up but not yet finished. The edges of the cover and paper are not aligned with each other."
    )
}}

To finish the notebook, all that was left to do at this point was to cut off some of the cover and paper along the edges, to get a smooth face. I used a combination square to cut a straight line, at a right angle to the spine.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/13-notebook-edge-cutting.jpg",
        alt="The notebook, a combination square held to it to allow for cutting in a straight, at a right angle to the spine."
    )
}}

Unfortunately, whatever skill you have to acquire, or talent you have to be born with, to hold a knife upright while cutting along the straight line, I don't have it. This led to a result that was less than straight.

Fortunately, a bit of sand paper did the trick.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/14-notebook-sanding.jpg",
        alt="The notebook, held in the book press. The visible face having been sanded to be a bit straighter than it was directly after the cut."
    )
}}

I started with a fine grid (120, I believe), but that didn't work very well. A coarser sandpaper (60, if memory serves) worked great.

The result still looked a bit ragged. Maybe this could be improved using another go with finer sandpaper, but I honestly like the rougher look. It's handmade, after all.

{{
    preview_image(
        path="/notes/notebook/15-notebook-one-face-finished.jpg",
        alt="The notebook up close, with one face sanded to be reasonably straight. The look is still somewhat ragged."
    )
}}

I repeated the cutting and sanding with the other sides, using the combination square to make sure all sides were roughly straight and square.

### Conclusion

As I said in the beginning, I'm very happy with the result, especially for a first try. Although there are things I'd do differently, as explained above.

I already started using it, to sketch some ideas. Using a notebook I made myself is a nice feeling! At this point, I have no firm plans, but I'm pretty sure I'll make another one at some point.
