Lots of process improvements on notebook #4, like a different technique for glueing on the bookmark, finishing the text block before adding the cover, and much more.

From a feature perspective, this one has thinner end pages, which makes the combination of end pages and cover less rigid. I think this is better, but there's still more to do in that area.

    )
}}

When opening the notebook fully, this puts tension on the first page after the end page, leading to the damage shown here. I need to find a solution for that. I have some ideas that I want to try in the next build.

    )
}}

I don't think I'll start with the next one right away though. I'm currently working on some tooling that I hope will improve the accuracy of the holes, and thus of the whole text block.

Here are some pictures I took during the build.
