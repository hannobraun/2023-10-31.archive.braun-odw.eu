Hey, I'm Hanno! I'm a self-employed software developer and maker, living in the beautiful [Odenwald](/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg) region in Germany.


### Fornjot

I work on [Fornjot](https://www.fornjot.app/), an early-stage project to create a next-generation, code-first CAD application. I've been experimenting with this for years on the side, and it's now my main professional focus.

If you're interested, check out [Fornjot's website](https://www.fornjot.app/) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hannobraun/Fornjot). If you want to support the project, [please consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun).


### Side Projects

I'm interested in making and small-scale manufacturing, and I'm working on a bunch of side projects related to that. [I used to make (and occasionally sell) notebooks](/products/notebook).

I'm also a big believer in open source, and do most of my work out in the open. Check out [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/hannobraun) to see what I'm up to.
