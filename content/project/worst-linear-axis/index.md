I had just moved into my new workshop. Being motivated to do *something*, but not really knowing what to do, nor having the material at hand for anything of consequence, I came up with a slightly crazy idea: Why not build a linear axis out of materials from the local hardware store?

Here's what I came up with using nothing but aluminium sheet, an aluminium rod, a threaded rod, screws, nuts, and some standard tools:

{{
    resized_image(
        path="project/worst-linear-axis/worst-linear-axis-v1.jpg",
        alt="A flimsy construction of bent aluminium sheet, resembling a linear axis."
    )
}}

Didn't work. Way too flimsly. No matter, on to version 2:

{{
    resized_image(
        path="project/worst-linear-axis/worst-linear-axis-v2.jpg",
        alt="Another aluminium sheet construction resembling a linear axis."
    )
}}

Those may well be the worst of their kind, but the second one works:
