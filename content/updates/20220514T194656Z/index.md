Finally started working on notebook #5! Tried some new things, like drilling the holes into the whole stack of paper all at once, instead of using an awl. Didn't go perfectly, but happy with the result.

The paper I used is also thicker than usual. Not sure yet what I think about that. Will have to see the end result.
