Doing some printer maintenance this evening. Nozzle was clogged. Idler screw seemed loose. Must have been a different root cause though, because it's not working again.

Can't load filament. The extrude motor will run, but it won't grab the filament. Not sure what's happening. Will have to take another look tomorrow.
