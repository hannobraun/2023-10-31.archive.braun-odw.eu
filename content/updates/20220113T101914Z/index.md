This year, I plan to focus on {{ ext_link(text="Fornjot", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/Fornjot") }}, my project to create a next-generation Code-CAD application. To make that work sustainable, I am {{ ext_link(text="seeking support from the community", url="https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun") }}. If you're interested in CAD, why not follow those links and check it out?
