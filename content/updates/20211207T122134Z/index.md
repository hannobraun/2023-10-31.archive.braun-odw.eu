I made a notebook! I started this project many months ago and procrastinated on it quite a bit. Hard to say why, in retrospect, because working on it was extremely satisfying. I guess it's just daunting to do something you never did before.

It's a bit rough, due to my decidedly non-professional skills and equipment. But I like it! It serves me well enough, and I look forward to making another one, once this first one is full.
