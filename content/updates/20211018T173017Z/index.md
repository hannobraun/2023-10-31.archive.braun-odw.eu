I'm still working on my printing issues. This picture shows some test prints consisting of only a first layer. I first thought those gaps between the layers were a sign of a partially clogged nozzle, but looking at it more closely, there seems to be a continuous extrusion.

Not sure what this means. Possibly under-extrusion, possibly a wrong value for extrusion width. In any case, I've decided to ignore the NonOilen for now and focus on getting the printer working with the Prusament PLA that I've been printing all this time.
