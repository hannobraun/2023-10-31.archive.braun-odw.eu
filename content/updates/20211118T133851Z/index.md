Did you see that {{ ext_link(text="Prusa XL announcement video", url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9peACH52KTo") }}? (There's also a {{ ext_link(text="blog post", url="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-xl-first-look_58312/") }}.) I mean, I'm not going to buy one; way too big for my needs! But man, those features. CoreXY, fully automatic first-layer calibration, tool changer, load cell sensor... if those are the signs of printers to come, I see more Prusa in my future.
