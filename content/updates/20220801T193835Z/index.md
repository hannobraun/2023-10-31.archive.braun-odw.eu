I ostensibly finished my Prusa Mini enclosure a while ago, but alas, the double-sided tape I used to hold the power setup on the back didn't hold. The power supply was too heavy, and when it fell, it pulled everything else with it. So I've printed this holder for it.

Very happy with how it came out! Seems very sturdy. I expect it to hold this time.
