I found out yesterday that my newsletter sign-up form hadn't been working in Chrome. **For months.** Of course I had tested it regularly, but in Firefox.

Well, now I know more about the pitfalls of cross-browser compatibility, and you can finally [sign up to my newsletter](/subscribe). If anything's not working, [please let me know](/contact)!
