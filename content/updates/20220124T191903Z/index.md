Things have gotten a bit quiet around here! My new focus on {{ ext_link(text="Fornjot", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/Fornjot") }} has disrupted my daily routine, and I've been busy getting everything back in order. I'm slowly settling into it and have started to make some progress with product development again.

So far, I've started to {{ ext_link(text="make a whole thing", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/notebook") }} out of my notebook-making hobby. Not sure at all where that will lead, but I guess we'll find out.
