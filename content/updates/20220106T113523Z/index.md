My latest newsletter went out yesterday and, if I can say so myself, it's a pretty good one. I mean, maybe not that interesting to the public at large, but if you want to keep track of what I'm up to, that's one you shouldn't have missed! (oops?)

But seriously, I actually plan to add a newsletter archive to the website, but that will take some work I don't really have time for, so we'll see when that happens. Until then, maybe [consider subscribing](/subscribe)? There's some behind-the-scenes stuff in there that I don't post anywhere else.
