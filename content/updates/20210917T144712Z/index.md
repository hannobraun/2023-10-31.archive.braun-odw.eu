I posted a [note about programmatic CAD software](/notes/programmatic-cad) yesterday. I plan to post more such non-project content in the future, although I will keep posting about projects too.

I have some more ideas in the pipeline, mainly about physical product development and prototyping topics I've been researching. Let me know what you think!
