Another upgrade to the printer enclosure: Just having a hole for the filament to go through turned out to not be ideal. Too much friction. A bit of PTFE tube should help.

I'm quite proud of my idea to go with a star-shaped hole. Has a bit of flex, so the tube can go in easily, but the fit is still very tight.
