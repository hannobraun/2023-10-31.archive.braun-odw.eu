Printed Screw Pad prototype #3 yesterday. Fixed the screw and added a signature to the bottom. The higher-resolution screw generation makes a clear difference, compared to prototype #1.

I'm considering to change the knurling pattern (this one feels a bit harsh) and thicken the wall of the nut (probably not necessary; but the thicker walls of the screw just look better, more solid). And the thread fit needs to be adjusted; it's a tiny bit loose.
