I printed another Screw Pad prototype last week (it's the one in front; the first one is in the back, for comparison). More knurling, less wasted material, higher-resolution thread generation. It doesn't work though! The screw part is too large and doesn't fit the nut. Fortunately I know [how to solve this problem](/notes/3d-printer-issues-accuracy-of-thin-walls/).
