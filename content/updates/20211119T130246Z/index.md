I've taken down the preview product page for the customizable spacer I was planning to sell. Turns out, manufacturing a fully customizable product is _really_ complicated, and I decided to go with something more manageable for my first product. I don't expect that to be a success anyway. It's all about learning.

However, the software I wrote for making a customizable OpenSCAD model available on a website is somewhat interesting, so I {{ ext_link(text="made that public", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/model-api") }} and [published a note](/notes/spacer) about it.

As for the new product, I've settled on an idea and I'm currently working on the design. I'll let you know, once I have something to show.
