Got a stack of paper in the mail today. It's a bit heavier than what I've used so far (120 g/m², as opposed to the usual 80 g/m²). But more importantly, it's the right size (A5). This saves work and eliminates one source of inaccuracy.

Looking forward to trying it, but first I need to finish notebook #4.
