Did you know that I'm working on my own CAD application? It's called  {{ ext_link(text="Fornjot", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot") }} (at least for now).

Despite working on this (including several previous iterations) for several years now, it's still highly experimental and not fit for general use, as I explored multiple approaches that ended up not working out. It's a lot of fun though, and I feel I'm hitting my stride lately. Maybe something will come out of this yet!
