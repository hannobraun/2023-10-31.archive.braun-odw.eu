Another tiny step of progress on notebook #6: The rubber strap seems to be attached well. The connection will become even stronger, once I've glued on the back side of the cover.

And I started doing just that. By next weekend, when I'm back here in the workshop, the glue will have dried, and I can hopefully finish the notebook.
