It took time, and some trial and error, but I've finally created a [working slicer profile for NonOilen](/notes/fillamentum-nonoilen-on-prusa-mini/). With that in hand, and my printer back under control, I've restarted my effort to create a physical product. More on that soon!

And since it's certain that I'll run into problems sooner or later, I want to be better prepared next time. Hopefully these books will help me step up my game!
