Took another look at the Prusa Mini extruder today. Filament was stuck in there. Cleaned it up. Couldn't find any root cause for these problems.

I think I just need to pay more attention to preparing the filament properly. You know, cutting it off at an angle, like the manual says, instead of doing nothing and hoping for the best.
