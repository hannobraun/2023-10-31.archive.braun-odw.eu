Better safe than sorry: I just installed {{ ext_link(text="a self-activating fire extinguisher", url="https://brandwaechter24.de/produkt/mini-aerosol-patch-feuerloesch-aufkleber/") }} into my printer enclosure. In case of fire, this thing is supposed to saturate the enclosure with some type of gas that quenches the fire immediately.
