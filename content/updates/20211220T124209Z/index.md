I printed some parts for a friend last week: a mold for a concrete planter ({{ ext_link(text="files downloaded from Thingiverse", url="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4728814") }}).

The parts I printed were a slightly modified remix, but the version was made by Alexandre Chappel. His {{ ext_link(text="video about this", url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBX42ZZNQas") }} is interesting!
