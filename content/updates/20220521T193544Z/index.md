Glued the end pages onto notebook #5. Trying a new technique with doubled-up end pages with this one (inspired by how Moleskines are constructed). I'm hoping this will make the notebooks more flexible, especially when opening it near the beginning or end.

We'll see how that turns out, once the cover is on.
