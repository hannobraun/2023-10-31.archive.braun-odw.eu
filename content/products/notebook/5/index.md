This one features a very noticeable change: I used heavier paper, leading to a much thicker notebook. Not sure how much I like it. It kind of feels nice, but I don't know if using it will actually be any better.

The new paper also has the correct size, so no need to cut it. This saved a lot of work in the early steps.
