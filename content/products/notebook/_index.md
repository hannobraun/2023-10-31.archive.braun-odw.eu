Notebooks, [Made in Odenwald](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg), directly from my workshop.


### Perfect for your back pocket

With a **vegan cork leather soft cover** and a size of around 105x145 mm (each one's a bit different), these are **perfect for carrying around**.


### Open source

This is an {{ ext_link(text="open source hardware product", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/notebook") }}. Tools, materials, build instructions... everything is documented!


### One of a kind

Each notebook is **numbered, unique, and has its own web page**. Check the links below to see all the notebooks I ever made.


### Interested?

**Want one of your own?** Then [let me know](/contact). There's currently a waiting list for the next few, and I'd be happy to put you on it. **Pay what you want!**
