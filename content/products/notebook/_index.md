Notebooks, [Made in Odenwald](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg), directly from my workshop.

- **Perfect for your back pocket:** Size of around 105x145mm (each one's a bit different), rounded edges, and vegan cork leather soft cover.
- **Open source:** Tools, materials, build instructions... {{ ext_link(text="everything is documented", url="https://github.com/hannobraun/notebook") }}!
- **One of a kind:** Each notebook is numbered, unique, and has its own web page. Check the links below to see all the notebooks I ever made.


**Want one of your own?** Then [let me know](/contact). There's currently a waiting list for the next few, and I'd be happy to put you on it. **Pay what you want!**
