One of the first things (maybe the first thing?) I printed on my Prusa Mini was the whistle model that came with the printer. It's a quick, useful print, but it has one problem: It's easy to drag out of your pocket without noticing.

After printing a few more to replace lost ones, I decided enough is enough.

Mine is heavily inspired by Prusa's model, but comes with a holder you can put a string through. Hang it around your neck, or attach it to some piece of clothing. It works pretty well (and is _very_ loud). I'm sure it can be improved more to get a better tone out of it.

Check out [my OpenSCAD model](whistle.zip), if you want to print your own.
