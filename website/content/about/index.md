Hey, I'm Hanno! I'm a self-employed maker, software developer, and vegan living in the beautiful [Odenwald](/made-in-odenwald/2.jpg) region in Germany, Europe.

### Interests

I'm interested in making, automation, manufacturing, and small businesses that do all that. I enjoy nature (which is why I live pretty much in the middle of it), and believe we should do what we can to preserve it.

This website is dedicated to these topics, and I keep adding content here regularly. If you enjoy it (or don't) [please let me know](/contact)! I appreciate your feedback.

I'm also a big believer in open source, and try to do as much of my work in the open as is practical. Check out my {{ ext_link(url="https://github.com/hannobraun", text="GitHub profile") }}, if you're interested in what I'm up to.
