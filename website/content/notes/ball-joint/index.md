I've been inspired by [this video of a 3D-printed ball joint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkHzmdVvHTg) and decided to make my own version.

{{

        path="/notes/ball-joint/ball-joint.jpg",
        alt="A 3D-printed, print-in-place ball joint."
    )
}}

Not much to it. Works pretty well, but could be a bit tighter, maybe (I followed the video's suggestion of leaving 0.5 mm of play).

{{
    video(
        path="/notes/ball-joint/ball-joint.webm",
        text="The ball joint in action."
    )
}}

If you want to print it yourself, [the OpenSCAD model](ball-joint.zip) is available for download.
