So here's a very specific problem: When eating peanuts out of a bowl, where do you put the husks? Not in the same bowl, surely, or finding un-eaten peanuts will become harder and harder. A second bowl might be unwieldy, depending on where you're sitting.

What to do? I present to you, the Peanut Bowl.

You fill one half with peanuts. As you eat them, the discarded husks go into the other chamber. They also stack, for easier storage.

I printed these out of PLA. Please note that 3D-printed PLA is usually not suitable for anything that comes into contact with food. I determined that it's okay in this case, as the bowl is designed to only ever come in contact with the husks of the peanuts, not the peanuts themselves.

As usual, [the OpenSCAD model](peanut-bowl.zip) is available for download.
