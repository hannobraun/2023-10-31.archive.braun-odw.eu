### News Feed

[`/atom.xml`](/atom.xml) provides a news feed for both updates and notes.

Currently only {{ ext_link(text="Atom", url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)") }} is supported. If that's a problem and you need support for {{ ext_link(text="RSS", url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS") }}, please [let me know](/contact).


### Social Media?

I'm currently considering to create several social media accounts, to make it easier for people to follow. Do you have a preferred platform where you'd like to follow me? [Let me know](/contact)!
