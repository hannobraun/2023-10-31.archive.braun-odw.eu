Are you a **maker** who's building, or already running, a **small manufacturing business** to sell your own product? I'm offering **free consulting services** to businesses like yours, and also software development and potentially CAD modeling services at reduced rates.


### Why offer free consulting?

I'm very interested in small, owner-operated manufacturing businesses that make and sell their own products. I want to learn more about what you do, what problems you face, and how I can be helpful.

Eventually, I want to run a profitable business selling products and services to that market. But for now, I need to learn all I can, and the best way to do that is to help real businesses, like yours! If you fit the above description, [please don't hesitate to contact me](/contact)!

Let me emphasize that: If you are building a business to make and sell your own product, **I want to talk to you**! Please don't be shy. If you're not sure whether you qualify, [please get in touch anyway](/contact)! No harm in asking!


### What I can do

I can be a bit of an idiot, but people sometimes compliment me for my insight, or just for getting them to think in new directions. Having someone with an outside perspective to bounce your ideas off of can be very valuable, and I figure that's the least I can provide.

Other than that, I can help you in the following areas:

- I've been self-employed for about a decade now (some of that time even semi-successfully), and I have done lots of thinking about business topics like positioning and marketing during that time.
- I've also been doing software development for over 20 years. If you're thinking about doing some custom software development, I'm sure to have opinions.
- I have lots of interest (although little experience) in industrial automation, and would like to figure out how automation can be a benefit in small-scale manufacturing.

And as mentioned above, if you need more than just advice, I'm happy to offer software development (and, to a lesser extent, CAD modeling) services at a reduced rate, to the right clients.


### Don't fit that description?

You aren't a maker building a small manufacturing business, but still think I can help you? [Please get in touch](/contact)! I'm always happy to talk about potential consulting or contracting engagements (although in that case, I'd have to charge full price).
