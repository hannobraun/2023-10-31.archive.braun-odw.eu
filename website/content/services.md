Are you a **maker** who's building, or already running, a **small manufacturing business** to sell your own product? I'm offering **free consulting services** to businesses like yours, and also software development and potentially CAD modeling services at reduced rates.


### Why offer free consulting?

I'm very interested in small, owner-operated manufacturing businesses that make and sell their own products. I want to learn more about what you do, what problems you face, and how I can be helpful.

Eventually, I want to run a profitable business selling products and services to that market. But for now, I need to learn all I can, and the best way to do that is to help real businesses, like yours! If you fit the above description, [please don't hesitate to contact me](/contact)!

Let me emphasize that: If you are building a business to make and sell your own product, **I want to talk to you**! Please don't be shy. If you're not sure whether you qualify, [please get in touch anyway](/contact)! No harm in asking!


### What can I help with?

As I expressed above, I'm still learning about manufacturing businesses, and I can't provide you with deep, encompassing expertise on the topic. However, I do believe I can bring some value:

- At the very least, I can provide an outside perspective. Explaining your ideas and processes to someone who's going to have stupid questions can sometimes be enough to get you thinking in new directions!
- With over 20 years of experience in software development, I have some insight into what works and what doesn't. If you're developing custom software, I'm sure to have opinions!
- In about a decade of self-employment, I spent a lot of time thinking about business. I might have some ideas for you too, specifically in the areas of positioning and marketing.
- I have lots of interest (although little experience) in industrial automation, and would like to figure out how automation can provide benefit in small-scale manufacturing.

And as I already mentioned, if you need more than just advice, I'm happy to offer software development (and, to a lesser extent, CAD modeling) services at a reduced rate, to the right clients.


### Don't fit that description?

You aren't a maker building a small manufacturing business, but still think I can help you? [Please get in touch](/contact)! I'm always happy to talk about potential consulting or contracting engagements (although in that case, I'd have to charge full price).
