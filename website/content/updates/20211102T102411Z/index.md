In my main workshop, I got this lamp with an integrated magnifying glass attached to my bench. I was missing something similar in my severely space-constrained home workshop, so I got  {{ ext_link(text="this tiny thing", url="https://wedo.de/Desk_Magnifier_POCKET_with_LED_light_black_white") }}.

I haven't used it extensively, so I can't give a firm recommendation yet, but it looks decent and literally fits in my pocket.
