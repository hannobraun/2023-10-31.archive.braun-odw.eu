Trying to track down some dimensional accuracy problems I'm having with those spacer models. The inner diameter is consistently too small, by up to 0.4mm. I played around with the slicer settings, but couldn't figure it out so far.

I figured it might be the printer, but those {{ ext_link(url="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/32539-xyz-10mm-calibration-cube", text="calibration cubes") }} are accurate within 0.1-0.2mm, which is well inside the {{ ext_link(url="https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/faq-frequently-asked-questions_1932/", text="expected range") }}.
