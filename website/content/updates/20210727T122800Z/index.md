The Atom feed links for these updates are still broken. I'm very sorry! This shouldn't be that hard to fix, but I'm faced with mystery problems at several parts of the stack I'm using to build/host this site (Zola and Netlify, to be specific).

Currently contemplating solutions. I have so many better things to do than spend the time to build a completely custom backend for this website, but it is so tempting...
