I'm still tweaking the website. Just renamed the "Projects" section to "Notes". I plan to post more content targeted at makers there, in addition to the project descriptions that I've posted so far.

Having separate sections on the website for that seemed overly complex, so I decided to lump it all together under one section. We'll see how that develops.
