The printer problems are never-ending! Now I'm seeing these blobby beads. Fortunately only in skirts so far, not in any print itself. My theory is that this is caused by the Mini's built-in first-layer calibration procedure.

I currently have a 0.25mm nozzle equipped, but the first-layer calibration assumes a 0.4mm nozzle, which could theoretically lead to excess material in the nozzle/hotend. If that's true, this will hopefully clear up soon. That, or I'll need to do more cold pulls...
