Now that my printer works again and all my problems are solved forever, I'm back to getting the {{ ext_link(text="NonOilen", url="https://www.fillamentumnonoilen.com/") }} to work. I made good progress, but am having some trouble with warping.

I'll post a note about printing NonOilen on a Prusa Mini, once I got it working sufficiently well.
