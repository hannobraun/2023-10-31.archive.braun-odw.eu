This is my first successful test print using {{ ext_link(url="https://www.fillamentumnonoilen.com/", text="NonOilen") }}. The attempt before that didn't adhere to the bed, which isn't a surprise with such a small print.

Some {{ ext_link(url="https://www.3dlac.com/", text="3DLAC") }} solved the problem. Using an adhesive is recommended anyway, when printing with NonOilen.

This was also the first time I used 3DLAC (or any bed adhesive). So far it seems great.
