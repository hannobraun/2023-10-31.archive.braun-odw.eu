I recently found these great articles by Jan Mr√°zek on his silicone casting process ({{ ext_link(url="https://blog.honzamrazek.cz/2021/04/making-silicone-components-with-a-resin-3d-printer-easy-vat-cleaning-for-elegoo-saturn/", text="[1]") }}, {{ ext_link(url="https://blog.honzamrazek.cz/2021/08/a-better-way-of-making-silicone-components-using-a-resin-printer-injection-molding-for-less-than-50-usd/", text="[2]") }}). He's using a resin printer to print the molds, as well as the rigid cores that he casts the silicon over. He's also developed a process for injecting the silicone into the mold, using cheap and available tools. Good stuff!

If you own an Elegoo Saturn, also check out the {{ ext_link(url="https://www.tindie.com/products/yaqwsx/resin-vat-cleaning-kit-for-elegoo-saturn/", text="casted cleaning kit he sells") }}.
