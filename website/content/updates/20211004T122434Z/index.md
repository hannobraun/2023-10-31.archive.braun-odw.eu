Still trying to track down the problem I'm having with the spacer model. Aside from the issue with the internal diameter, there seems to be the additional problem of the NonOilen prints being ever so slightly smaller than the PLA prints.

I'm knee-deep in slicer settings now, which is fun but also a bit overwhelming.
