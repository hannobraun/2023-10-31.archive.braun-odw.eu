I was hoping to solve some printing problems, not create new ones! Lately, I've been having problems with my calibration cubes. They are higher than they should be, the first few layers are smaller than nominal (only the first layer should be a bit smaller, according to slicer settings), and there's a bulge on one side.

I've inspected the G-Code, using the slicer as well as manually, and everything looks good there. I'm suspecting a firmware problem (probably unlikely, but it's one variable that changed) or a clogged nozzle (not sure how that would cause these results, but I've seen other signs of that).

At least I'm pretty sure I'll come out of this having learned more about 3D printing, but it's hard not be a tiny bit frustrated ðŸ˜„
