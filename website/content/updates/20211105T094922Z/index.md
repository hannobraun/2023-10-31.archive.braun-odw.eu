I crashed my printer yesterday! Into the screws at the back of the heat bed, that serve as a stop for the steel sheets. No visible damage. The nozzle just flexed out of the way, but I don't know if anything was knocked out of alignment.

Lesson learned: PrusaSlicer will happily let you drive the nozzle into those screws, if you tell it to. Even though it usually throws an error at you, if it sees a path that is out of bounds.
