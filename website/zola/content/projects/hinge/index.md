This is a 3D-printed hinge. It doesn't serve a purpose in itself, but it can be used as a component of other prints.

    preview_image(
        path="projects/hinge/hinge.jpg",
        alt="A 3D-printed hinge."
    )
}}

It's printed in-place, meaning the moving parts come off the printer fully assembled. It took a bit of tweaking, but the latest prototype works very well.

As always, I'm providing [the OpenSCAD model](hinge.zip) for download.
