Sometimes you need something to put your soap on.

{{
    resized_image(
        path="projects/soap-dish/soap-dish.jpg",
        alt="A 3D-printed soap dish."
    )
}}

It prints best with variable layer height (I don't think the one pictured here had that enabled). The automatic setting in PrusaSlicer (without any smoothing) seemed to work best.

        alt="A 3D-printed soap dish, with soap on it."
    )
}}

This one was a big hit. I think I printed 5 of the final version (plus a few prototypes). There are 3 different households storing their soap on those now, which feels nice.

If you need one for your own sink, check out [the OpenSCAD model](soap-dish.zip).
